Sync: aa aa aa ...
Preamble: 2d d4 - actually preamble[] = {0xAA, 0x2D, 0xD4};
FF: Family code 0x51 (ECOWITT/FineOffset WH51)
IIIIII: ID (3 bytes)
T: Transmission period boost: highest 3 bits set to 111 on moisture change and decremented each transmission;
if T = 0 period is 70 sec, if T > 0 period is 10 sec
B: Battery voltage: lowest 5 bits are battery voltage * 10 (e.g. 0x0c = 12 = 1.2V). Transmitter works down to 0.7V (0x07)
YY: ? Fixed: 0x7f
MM: Moisture percentage 0%-100% (0x00-0x64) MM = (AD - 70) / (450 - 70)
Z: ? Fixed: leftmost 7 bit 1111 100
AAA: 9 bit AD value MSB byte[07] & 0x01, LSB byte[08]
XXXXXX: ? Fixed: 0xff 0xff 0xff
CC: CRC of the preceding 12 bytes (Polynomial 0x31, Initial value 0x00, Input not reflected, Result not reflected)
